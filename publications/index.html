This is the first Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Indicator Baseline report for Ghana. The report provides a baseline status for a set of SDGs indicators and serves as a reference point for tracking progress on the achievement of the SDGs and the corresponding Africa Union’s Agenda 2063.</p>

<p>This report serves as a template for a series of annual SDG-budgeting reports. The primary purpose of this baseline report is threefold. First, to start developing a methodology that provides a more proactive and collaborative SDGs integrated budgeting process, within and among Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Second, to develop techniques that make future tracking of annual and cumulative funding in the budget more accurate. These will be from various sources that support the SDGs, targets and indicators. Finally, to build the baseline for a report-series that combines government financing flows with impact data based on the SDGs indicators from the National Statistical System. Ultimately, the aim is to support the process towards achieving the 2030 Agenda. The theme of the 2018 budget is “Putting Ghana Back to Work”.</p>

<p>This document, the United Nations Sustainable Development Partnership (UNSDP) 2018-2022, reflects Ghana’s national goals and its commitments to global development initiatives and sets out the UN system’s collective contributions to help the Government and other stakeholders achieve these goals. In particular the UNSDP is aligned to The Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies, 2017–2024, which sets out a vision for agricultural modernization, industrial diversification, and youth employment; embeds national strategies to localise and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; and articulates a self - reliant pathway to economic transformation and inclusive growth. The UNSDP also reflects the findings of the UN’s Common Country Assessment (2016) of the underlying development challenges in Ghana and of the Human Rights Assessment (2016) to identify who is at risk of not having their human rights protected and thus of being left behind.</p>

Inclusive and equitable quality education form an integral part of building a society. The quest of Sustainable Development Goal Four (4), ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for all is therefore very important. This academic thesis seeks to assess the SDG Four (4) in relation to the standard of basic education in Ghana. The core  objectives  of  this  work  were  to  find  out  the  extent  to  which  the  various  Educational Reforms  have  helped  solve  the  issue  of  quality  basic  education  in  Ghana.  Generally speaking, the research conceives that the attainment of SDG Four (4) is very important for Ghana’s development. The research revealed that over the past eight (8) years, the standard of quality basic education in the country has been decreasing. Ghana is making considerable progress towards attainment of the SDG</p>
